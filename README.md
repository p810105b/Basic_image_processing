# Basic_image_processing

## Sampling and Quantization  
1. Sampling the image pixels in even positions  
2. Down sample the image with factor 2  
3. Up sample the image in request 2 to the original size  
4. Quantizing image from 256 levels to 8 levels  

## Blur and Edge detect
1. Blurring the image with average filter.   
2. Blurring the image with gaussian filter.   
3. Blurring the image with median filter.  
4. Find the edge with Sobel or Laplacian operator.  
5. Find the edge with Canny algorithm.  

## Huffman code
Huffman data compression  

## Morphology
1. Transfer the image to binary image.  
2. Complete dilation and erosion with 3 * 3 structure element.   
3. Complete open and close based on dilation and erosion.  
4. Find edge with 1 ~ 3 methods.
